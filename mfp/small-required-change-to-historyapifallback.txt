Small Required Change to historyApiFallback
Before starting on the next section, we will need to fix up a bug related to the historyApiFallback settings. Otherwise, you will be met with 404 errors in certain situations such as directly accessing http://localhost:8081/pricing.

Find this code in the webpack/dev.js file in both marketing and the container:

  devServer: {
    port: 8082,
    historyApiFallback: {
      index: "index.html",
    },
  },
You may resolve the issue by adding a / to the front of index.html:

  devServer: {
    port: 8082,
    historyApiFallback: {
      index: "/index.html",
    },
  },
Or, by setting to true:

  devServer: {
    port: 8082,
    historyApiFallback: true,
  },
After making this change, remember to restart both of your servers.
